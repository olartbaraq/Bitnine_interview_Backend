Advantages of using recursive implementation:
simple to understand and implement
easy to express the recurrence relation

Disadvantages of using recursive implementation:
It is highly inefficient, as it recalculates the same subproblems multiple times, leading to a high time complexity of O(3^n)
It will cause the stack overflow if n becomes large



Advantages of using memoization:
More efficient than the recursive implementation, as it avoids recalculating the same subproblems multiple times
Reduce the time complexity to O(n)

Disadvantages of using memoization:
requires additional memory to store the memoization table.
the maximum value of n is limited by the size of the memoization table


Advantages of using tabulation implementation:
More efficient than the recursive and memoization approach, as it avoids recalculating the same subproblems multiple times
Reduce the time complexity to O(n)
No stack overflow problem

Disadvantages of using tabulation implementation:
It requires additional memory to store the array f.
It's not as intuitive as the recursive approach for expressing the recurrence relation.
